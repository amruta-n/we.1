							Kesari bath is a sweet Indian food that is common throughout the country. The classic ingredients used for its preparation are semolina, sugar, ghee, water, and milk. The dish might be prepared with pineapple, banana, mango, coconut, or rice. The dish is common in the cuisine of Karnataka as well as of multiple regions in South India and is a popular dish during festivals such as Ugadi. The word kesari in multiple Indian languages refers to the spice saffron which creates the dish's saffron-orange-yellow-colored tinge. Though it is a sweet dish, in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, it is prepared not only as a dessert but also for normal breakfasts. It is also served with uppittu or khara bath, and a serving of both dishes on one plate is popularly called "chow chow bath".

							South Indian filter coffee is a coffee drink made by mixing frothed and boiled milk with the infusion obtained by percolation brewing of finely ground coffee powder in a traditional Indian filter. The drink known as Kaapi, is the South Indian phonetic realisation of "coffee". The drink is also referred to as Madras filter coffee, Madras kaapi, Kumbakonam degree coffee, Mylapore filter coffee, or Mysore filter coffee. Outside India the term "filter coffee" may refer to drip brew coffee, which is a distinct form of preparing coffee.
